# Guessing Game Exemplar

This application is a guessing game where the computer tries to guess a number between 1 and 100 that the user is thinking of. The computer's logic is based on binary search. The user's feedback on the computer's guesses (higher, lower, or correct) is predicted using a model.

## ðŸ’» Running the Exemplar

To clone and run the exemplar:

1. Click the green **Use this template** button, then choose **Create a new repository**.
2. On the **Create a new repository** page, choose your GitHub username from the **Owner** dropdown, and enter a name for your repository. This creates a new repository on your account with same directory structure, branches, and files as the original.
3. Click the **Code** button, then copy the HTTPS link.
4. In VS Code, open the **Source Control** tab.
5. Click the **Clone Repository** button, then paste the link in the command palette that appears.
6. The repository will then be copied to your computer, and you'll be prompted to open the directory.
7. After opening the directory, open and run `App.java` to run the program.

## ðŸ”Ž Existing Code

### GuessingGame.java

The `GuessingGame` class interfaces with all the classes and serves as the main driver of the game experience.

**Suggested Modifications and New Features:**

* Implement save and resume game functionality.
* Introduce user profiles or game history tracking.
* Offer in-game tutorials or guidance for newcomers.

### MainScene.java

The `MainScene` class constructs the primary game interface, which displays prompts, receives user responses, and presents computer predictions.

**Suggested Modifications and New Features:**

* Introduce robust error handling and user-friendly messages.
* Add features such as scoreboards or multiplayer modes.

### GameOverScene.java

The `GameOverScene` class displays the game's outcome and provides options for restarting or exiting.

**Suggested Modifications and New Features:**

* Display a summary of game statistics.
* Introduce varying game-over graphics or animations based on outcomes.

### Loading.java

The `Loading` class manages the loading animations and labels shown during camera initialization or data processing.

**Suggested Modifications and New Features:**

* Introduce different loading animations for variety.
* Display a loading percentage or estimated time remaining.
* Implement a retry or cancel mechanism for prolonged loading times.

## âœ… TO DO: GameLogic.java

The `GameLogic` class controls the core mechanics of the game, determining the computer's guessing strategy and processing user input.

Implement the following methods in `GameLogic.java` to incorporate your Teachable Machine model in the app.

`binarySearch(String predictedClass)`

* Use the `predictedClass` to determine if the user thinks the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
* If the guess is too high, call `guessLower()`.
* If the guess is too low, call `guessHigher()`.
* If the guess is correct, call `guessCorrect()`.
* If the `predictedClass` is invalid or doesn't match any of the expected values, return `-1`.

`isGuessCorrect(String predictedClass)`

* Check if the `predictedClass` corresponds to the correct guess (e.g., check if `predictedClass` equals `"stop"` or another relevant string).
* Return `true` if the guess is correct, and `false` otherwise.

`guessHigher()`

* Update the `left` boundary to be the current `guess`.
* Calculate the new `guess` as the midpoint between `left` and `right`.
* Return the new `guess`.

`guessLower()`

* Update the `right` boundary to be the current `guess`.
* Calculate the new `guess` as the midpoint between `left` and `right`.
* Return the new `guess`.

`guessCorrect()`

* Since the current `guess` is correct, return the current `guess`.
